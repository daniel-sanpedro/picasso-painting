creating a picasso painting using

-html
-css

requirements are:
-Use grid or flex.
-Use three various types of CSS units.
-Make sure it works on all screen sizes. Some people will not be able to attend the gallery but they have a virtual gallery room.
-Desktop: 1680 x 1050
-iPad: 1024 x 768
-Mobile: 480 x 320
-You must use z-index and hierarchical selectors in the code.
-Use common shorthand where applicable.
-Add an HTML form to collect the names and emails of interested visitors.
-It should have a submit button and the form's action will take the user to another HTML page.
Note: the form does not actually need to collect information! You can direct the user to another HTML page by assigning a value to the <form>'s action attribute.
